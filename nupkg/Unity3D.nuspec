    <description>Simple, forward-compatible references to ANY Unity assembly on ANY platform.</description>
    <releaseNotes>
- Unity version can now be parsed automatically from the ProjectVersion.txt file in a Unity project, if not set explicitly.
- Added many new short-hand properties, with more consistent naming (relative paths end in "Dir" or "Assembly", absolute paths end in "Path")
- Renamed "OSInstallRoot" property to "OSInstallRootPath" and "UnityInstallRoot" to "UnityInstallRootPath", to be consistent with other prop names
- Reference Include paths no longer need to start with $(UnityInstallRoot)/$(UnityVersion). Most paths will now use a single short-hand property
- If neither UnityVersion nor UnityProjectPath are explicitly set, then UnityVersion is set to a constant string to explain the issue
- Add UnityVersionMajor, UnityVersionMinor, UnityVersionPatch, and UnityVersionAsNumber props for manipulation of Unity versions as numbers
- Assembly short-hand properties are now conditionally defined based on UnityVersion
- Updated usage notes in all Readme documents
- Added test projects for Tech Stream Unity releases up through 2022.1
