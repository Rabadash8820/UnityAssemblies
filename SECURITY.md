## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs in this NuGet package seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub ["Open a draft security advisory"](https://github.com/Rabadash8820/UnityAssemblies/security/advisories/new) page.

A contributor will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report.
After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party assets/packages to the person or team maintaining them.
You can also read [Unity's security guidelines](https://unity.com/security) for reporting vulnerabilities in their software.

## Escalation

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of your report within one week, or if you cannot find a private security contact for the project, you may escalate to the original author directly: [dan.vicarel@gmail.com](dan.vicarel@gmail.com).

If the project acknowledges your report but does not provide any further response or engagement within two weeks, escalation is also appropriate.
