# Changelog

All notable changes to the [Unity3D NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity3D/) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 3.0.0 - 2024-07-16

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Rabadash8820/UnityAssemblies/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc2) or [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity3D/3.0.0-rc2).

### Added in 3.0.0

- Internal: test project for Unity 6 Beta release

### Fixed in 3.0.0

- `NUnityAssembly` value for Unity 6+ projects

## 3.0.0-rc1 - 2024-07-16

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Rabadash8820/UnityAssemblies/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rc1) or [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity3D/3.0.0-rc1).

### Changed in 3.0.0-rc1

- All Unity module assemblies are now referenced by default (including the one named `UnityEngine.dll`), rather than the monolithic `UnityEngine.dll`,
  so projects don't have to remove the default references in order to work with UPM package assemblies.
- Default references can be easily toggled off by setting the `IncludeDefaultUnityAssemblyReferences` property to `False`
- All short-hand properties and default references are now added by a `.targets` file rather than `.props`,
  removing the need to move `UnityVersion` and/or `UnityProjectPath` property definitions to a `Directory.Build.props` file

### Removed in 3.0.0-rc1

- `UnityAnalyticsStandardEvents*` MSBuild properties for Unity 2020.3+ projects, since those paths have never existed on those Unity versions

## 2.1.3 - 2023-08-16

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Rabadash8820/UnityAssemblies/releases/tag/v2.1.3) or [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity3D/2.1.3).

### Changed in 2.1.3

- Internal: Added a `--no-pack` option to the publish script for easier testing
- Split up the main Readme into multiple Markdown files under `docs/` so that different documentation versions can exist side-by-side in perpetuity

### Fixed in 2.1.3

- `$(NunitAssembly)` property now uses `net*` rather than `net35` to account for later versions of Unity's "Custom NUnit" package that use a `net40` version of the assembly

### Added in 2.1.3

- README documentation about using this package in CI/CD Pipelines
- Internal: test projects for Tech Stream Unity releases up through 2023.2

### Changed in 2.1.0

- Newtonsoft.Json short-hand properties now use the path in Unity's install folder for Unity 2022.2+
- All short-hand properties for UPM assemblies now include `@` in the name, to prevent name conflicts for assemblies with "nested namespace" names

## 2.0.1 - 2022-06-01

- Documentation on using the numeric Unity version properties in MSBuild files
- Support documentation to main README
- Internal: test projects for Tech Stream Unity releases up through 2022.1

## [2.0.0-rc1] - 2022-05-21

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Rabadash8820/UnityAssemblies/releases/tag/v2.0.0-rc1) or [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Unity3D/2.0.0-rc1).

### Added in 2.0.0-rc1

- Many new short-hand properties, with more consistent naming (relative paths end in `Dir` or `Assembly`, absolute paths end in `Path`)

### Changed in 2.0.0-rc1

- Unity version can now be parsed automatically from the `ProjectVersion.txt` file in a Unity project, if not set explicitly (requires `UnityProjectPath` to be set)
- Reference Include paths no longer need to start with `$(UnityInstallRoot)\$(UnityVersion)`\. Most paths will now use a single short-hand property.
- If neither `UnityVersion` nor `UnityProjectPath` is explicitly set, then `UnityVersion` is set to a constant string to explain the issue.
- `UnityVersion` or `UnityProjectPath` must be set in a `Directory.Build.props`, not the project file.
- ASCII art in package readme.txt to use new Unity logo
